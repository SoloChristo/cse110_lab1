## Programming Back Group


I started programming in 2014, my first language was
python, although I did not really start coding
until I was at **Miracosta College**. Java, was really the first
language I learned and gained knowledge in. However, I always loved the idea
that programmers should have full control over their computers hardware.
So, I needed a language that was not Java. *C++* values the power that computers
give to each programmer and it does not worry to much about keeping you safe 
from the computers oddities. This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes. 
> To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer. - Paul R. Ehrlich

And now for a random code snippet 
```javascript
    if (isAwesome){
        return false
    }
```
