## Programming Back Group


I started programming in 2014, my first language was
python, although I did not really start coding
until I was at **Miracosta College**. Java, was really the first
language I learned and gained knowledge in. However, I always loved the idea
that programmers have full control over the computer that they are programming.
So, I needed a language that was not Java. *C++* values the power the a computer
gives to each programmer and it does not worry to much about keeping you safe 
from the computer. This reminds me of my favorite quotes. 
> To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer. - Paul R. Ehrlich
